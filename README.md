# Experiment

Tumor cells were plated into a 96-well plate in presence of a few immun cells (PBMCs) (in order to initiate the reaction start) then covered with Matrigel. Additional immune cells (PBMCs) were plated onto the top of the Matrigel in presence/lack of different treatment to compare the immune cell activation and cell migration over 9 days.
