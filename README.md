# Experiment

Tumor cells were plated (NCI tumor cell line) into a 96-well plate in presence of a few immun cells (PBMC-derived T cells) (in order to initiate the reaction start) then covered with mixture of Matrigel and Collagen. Additional immune cells (PBMC-derived T cells) were plated onto the top of the Matrigel in presence/lack of different treatment to compare the immune cell activation and cell migration over 9 days.
